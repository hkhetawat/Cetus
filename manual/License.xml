    <para>In recent years, there has been an explosion in the number of
    open-source licenses, and we do not wish to contribute further to that
    problem, but this was the only license upon which all involved parties
    were able to agree. We suggest that you do not use this license for
    projects that do not involve Cetus.</para>

    <para>The Cetus License is a modified Artistic License, similar to the
    Perl Artistic License. Artistic Licenses are generally <command
    xlink:href="http://www.opensource.org">OSI</command> approved, although
    this specific license has not been submitted to OSI. You can view the
    license on the download page <command
    xlink:href="http://cetus.ecn.purdue.edu/download.html">
    here</command>.</para>
